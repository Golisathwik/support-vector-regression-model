A Support Vector Regressor is a powerful machine learning algorithm, an extension of Support Vector Machines, used for regression tasks by finding a "best-fit" hyperplane that tolerates a certain amount of error while maximizing the margin, focusing only on critical data points outside this margin to avoid overfitting and capture underlying trends.
